"""This package contains miscellaneous routines and classes, e.g. for 
preprocessing and feature extraction which are independent of the used
framework (blocks, tensorflow...). For example, this includes rolling 
out sparse features into a dense representation or searching for the 
best surface form for a given attribute vector. ``trie`` contains a
generic trie implementation, ``unigram`` can be used for keeping 
track of unigram statistics during decoding.
